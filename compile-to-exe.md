# Converting a Python Script to a Standalone Executable (.exe) Using Auto PY to EXE

To convert a Python script to a standalone executable (.exe) file using Auto PY to EXE, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Install Auto PY to EXE

You can install Auto PY to EXE using pip. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

## Step 2: Run Auto PY to EXE

Once installed, run Auto PY to EXE by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```

## Step 3: Configure the Settings

The Auto PY to EXE GUI will open. In the GUI, you’ll see various options and settings. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the “Browse” button and select your Python script file.
2. Adjust other settings as needed, such as adding additional files or modules, selecting an output directory, and setting other options based on your requirements.

## Step 4: Select the Compilation Mode

Choose the compilation mode based on whether you want a single executable file or a folder with the executable and supporting files.

## Step 5: Click “Convert .py to .exe”

After configuring the settings, click the “Convert .py to .exe” button to start the conversion process. Wait for the process to complete.

## Step 6: Find the Output

Once the conversion is complete, you will find the generated .exe file in the specified output directory.

That’s it! You should now have a standalone .exe file that you can distribute and run without installing Python on the target machine.
